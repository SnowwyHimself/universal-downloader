## Features

- **Universal download** — one input field. Paste a link from anywhere yt-dlp supports; Universal Downloader auto-detects the platform and fetches a preview (thumbnail, title, uploader, duration, quality options).
- **Maximum quality, zero loss** — always grabs `bestvideo+bestaudio` and merges with ffmpeg, remuxing (no re-encode) whenever codecs allow. MP3 extraction at 320 kbps.
- **Converter** — drop in local files to change format: video→audio, video→video, audio→audio. Remux when possible, high-quality re-encode when not. Batch queue supported.
- **Live queue** — concurrent downloads/conversions with per-item progress (percent, speed, ETA, cancel) plus a history with *Open* / *Show in folder*.
- **Clipboard watch** — optionally offers to download when you copy a media link.
- **Fast &amp; responsive** — all yt-dlp/ffmpeg work runs in child processes; the UI never blocks. Concurrent fragment downloading for speed.
- **Cross-platform parity** — identical features and look on Windows and macOS: custom frameless title bar, bundled Inter font, styled scrollbars, dark &amp; light themes.

## Tech

- **Electron** + Node.js — clean `contextBridge` IPC, no embedded server.
- **yt-dlp** for downloading, with in-app self-update (sites break it constantly, so keeping it current is critical).
- **ffmpeg / ffprobe** for merging &amp; conversion.
- Binaries are downloaded per-platform at build time (`scripts/prepare-binaries.js`) and staged into a writable per-user dir on first launch so yt-dlp can self-update.
- All input passed to yt-dlp/ffmpeg via `spawn` argument arrays — never shell strings — since URLs are untrusted.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # launch the app (uses a system yt-dlp/ffmpeg on PATH if present)
```

The renderer (`src/renderer/`) is plain HTML/CSS/JS and degrades gracefully in a
normal browser for quick UI iteration.

## Building

Each OS is built on its own machine (macOS locally, Windows via CI). The build
first downloads the correct binaries for the current platform.

```bash
npm run icon        # (re)generate the app icon
npm run build       # macOS  → dist/*.dmg
npm run build:win   # Windows → dist/*Setup.exe (NSIS)
```
